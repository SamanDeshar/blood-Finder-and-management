The application uses the IP address of the user to determine their longitude and latitude. This data is then utilized alongside the Haversine algorithm to calculate the distance between the user and registered blood donors in the database. The system identifies and displays the nearest blood donors based on this information. Additionally, the application includes functionality to upload and manage the donor and blood bank data within the database.
